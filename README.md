### Matrix Determinant Calculator

This program calculates the determinant of any matrix.

To do so, it performs a cofactor expansion along the first row (also called a [Laplace expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_expansion)). This is implemented using recursion, which is not super efficient, but still works well for smaller matrices.

To generate some of the matrices in the input files, I used this [random matrix generator](https://onlinetools.com/math/generate-random-matrix). To calculate the expected value of the determinants (which I have listed in each file), I used this [matrix calculator](https://matrixcalc.org/). These tools facilitate inputting any matrix.
